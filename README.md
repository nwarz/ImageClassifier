# ImageClassifier
A simple image classifier using the CIFAR-10 labeled image dataset. CIFAR-10 images are 32 by 32 pixels and are labelled with one of ten classes. Currently includes a simple K-nearest neighbor classifier that achieves about 34% accuracy on the test set. Future plans include implementing more accurate SVM, softmax, or neural netowrk classification techniques.
